I am a Cloud Solution Engineer in the Analytics and Machine Learning department where I help clients address pressing business use cases by providing descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive analytics.  In other words, I serve as a data science and machine learning consultant helping clients find and implement solutions.  In one example, I helped a semiconductor manufacturer find patterns in their data to help reduce the number of rejected semiconductors.  This required creating a pipeline for the data and combining data from disparate data sources to enable data exploration and building predictive models.  I helped establish a big data warehouse through our cloud solution, Autonomous Data Warehouse, and connected the data to a data visualization tool, Oracle Analytics Cloud.  The machine learning model results were imported into the visualization tool.  The ultimate goal is to both ground and recommend solutions for a particular business use case.  With respect to this client, we recommended a specific equipment path to reduce the number of rejected semiconductors.  Since I work with clients from different industries and donâ€™t understand their domain, It is crucial to ask the right questions.
